    <h2>The process of curating a wardrobe on a budget</h2>
    <h3>19.10.24-ongoing</h3>
    <p>A few years ago, I lost a substantial amount of weight. I was left with no clothes that fit properly. I realized I needed to get clothes that fit me, and that I had an opportunity to develop a new wardrobe/personal style. The only problem is that I’m sort of “balling” on a college student’s budget – meaning not very much!</p>
    <p>So, what’s the first step when trying to develop a personal style without much liquid? Some might say to hit the thrift shop. I, and many others, say to style items you already own. There are so many different ways you can wear your clothing. If folding, tucking, and pinning all aren’t working – try wearing your clothes the wrong way! </p>
    <p>A lot of young people in Detroit have their first experience at an after-hours venue at a club known for the goth night that’s regularly held there. Goth night events are usually held in cities that can support a fulltime goth club. I love music, especially goth music, and going out, but I don’t own “club” clothes. After over a year of living in Detroit, I still don’t. When choosing an outfit for my second goth night (the outfit I wore at the first goth night is a top for another day), I had to get creative. </p>
    <p>The evening of that goth night, when I was trying to put an outfit together, I was eyeing a black, button-up dress in my closet. Back when it fit well, this dress was one of my favorite pieces of clothing. I’ve worn it to a funeral, school dance, and a wedding. Wearing it normally isn’t an option anymore – it’s just too big. I decided to try this dress on, and I started trying to wrap it around my body in different ways and styling it with a belt. I achieved an outfit with a deconstructed appearance. I paired the dress with a pair of boots I ordered years ago. I hadn’t worn the boots ever because I underestimated their height and length.</p>
    <p>An item that absolutely has saved me over the past few years is this pair of ribbed biker shorts I ordered on Amazon. I wear them under all of my skirts and dresses as safety shorts. They came in a back of three with two other colors (grey/blue), and they are wonderful for working out and layering. I have no complaints about the quality. The fabric returns to shape well and, after two years of frequent use, they look like I got them yesterday. Unfortunately, they were probably a drop shipped item, but I’m satisfied with how inexpensive they were and how well they’ve held up.  You can find those shorts here. </p>
    <p>Overall I think I did well on the outfit for what I had. I’m looking to update it, so maybe I’ll post about that sometime in the future. That’s just one time I made use of what I already had instead of seeking out </p>
