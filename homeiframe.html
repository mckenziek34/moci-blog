    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I’m Mckenzie, an undergraduate student and creative living in Detroit. I realized sometime ago I wanted to start a blog to track my experiences in the city, as a young woman, and student. I got the idea for ‘MoCi’ (Motor City) when I was considering how Detroit businesses both are shaped by and form the cultural fabric of Detroit. My goal with the MoCi blog is to promote and advocate for artistic and individual expression in Detroit – especially when creating and promoting small businesses and projects in the city. On this site, I plan to feature an exploration into Detroit businesses – chiefly what advantages Detroit businesses have and what they lack compared to businesses in other cities. I plan to showcase my experiences in Detroit along with personal and commercial art projects – including the processes behind them. I also plan to create digital galleries for sketches, random photos, event experiences, and more!</p>
<p>I’m interested in everything. I’m interested in IT/technology in general, art, music, and making clothing! I also love video games and game design – another interest I'll explore further on this blog. As a project based in Detroit, I’ll share a lot of the imagery that inspires my creations. I’ll also talk about plans for Detroit and even share about decisions I think would benefit the city. </p>
<p>Overall, I hope to share my experience with self expression in the Motor City!</p>

    <h1>Why should you have a blog?</h1>
    <p>A blog is the best way to engage an audience without sacrificing personality or expression. The more advanced you develop it, the fewer restrictions on what types of digital content you can share with an audience. A major pitfall of modern social media is that account/post visibility, even to followers, is how well an account owner is able to use the platform’s features to engage other users. On platforms such as Instagram, it’s no longer guaranteed that those who follow you are receiving your posts.</p>
<p>It’s possible to use other platforms to host micro-blogs, but those blogs lack authority. In many instances, those blogs are limited in what they can say/post due to the restrictive nature of social media. With my blog, I can talk about how much I love people that wear their shoes backwards without fear of censorship or an entire lifetime of post history getting deleted. </p>

<h2>What is a blog and what should a blog look like?</h2>
<p>A blog should have a home page and a way to access all of the other pages – a basic structure. It should include a sitemap, particularly if there are many subpages. I believe blogs should be seen as spaces that represent an individual or a group. To me, it’s important that a blog’s appearance reflects the personality of whoever it represents. Curating a blog is a form of creative expression. Artists and designers don’t take this sort of expression lightly. They create miniature worlds with their work. Publishing a blog is an opportunity to wrap other people into a world of your design. </p>
<p>As I’m developing my blog, something I’m concerned with is maintaining readability without sacrificing personal expression. Although readability might be important for a blog like mine, that could be different for an individual with more creative intentions with their blog. 
</p>
<p>Something I think that’s important when designing a blog is interactivity. Blogs are digital objects that have a high ceiling for interactivity. Those that run blogs should view that as an opportunity to further absorb their audience. </p>
